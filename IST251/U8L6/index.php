<p class="directions"><b><?php echo "Unit: $unit Lab: $lab: $topic"; ?></b> Make sure you are able to understand
	and code all of the examples in the unit for this week. 
	Remember, don't simply copy and paste the dowloaded examples. It's ok to use them as a guide while learning,
	but you want to type them in and understand the PHP.</p>
